# About Me

I am a professor of marine ecology and data sciences at the [Complexys](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/infossur/intranet/complexys/Pages/default.aspx) and [Biosciences](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/infossur/intranet/biosciences/Pages/default.aspx) Institutes, [University of Mons](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/Pages/default.aspx) (UMONS), Belgium. My research interests include [coral ecophysiology](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/universite/facultes/fs/services/institut_bio/ecologie_numerique_milieux_aquatiques/Pages/CORAUX.aspx), [artificial reef mesocosms](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/universite/facultes/fs/services/institut_bio/ecologie_numerique_milieux_aquatiques/Pages/Mesocosmesartificiels.aspx), automatic identification of [plankton images](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/universite/facultes/fs/services/institut_bio/ecologie_numerique_milieux_aquatiques/Pages/PLANCTON.aspx), growth models (see my [Ph.D. thesis](http://go.sciviews.org/thesis_PhG)), machine learning algorithms, [evolution and ecology of open source software](http://informatique.umons.ac.be/genlog/projects/ecos/). I lead the [Numerical Ecology of Aquatic Systems unit](http://portail.umons.ac.be/en2/universite/facultes/fs/services/institut_bio/ecologie_numerique_milieux_aquatiques/pages/default.aspx), which studies coral and plankton, and develops [software for the ecologist](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/universite/facultes/fs/services/institut_bio/ecologie_numerique_milieux_aquatiques/Pages/Logiciels.aspx). 

I teach the whole curriculum of data sciences to students in biology at the [Faculty of Science](http://portail.umons.ac.be/EN2/universite/facultes/fs/Pages/default.aspx) at UMONS where we emphasize the importance of good practice for reproducible research and open science. I am also in charge of the courses in marine ecology, ecophysiology, oceanography, and aquariology at UMONS.

I am a creative person who spends a lot of time thinking about (new) ways to solve problems. I like to dig in data with my favorite environment: a customised R session (I also maintain more than a dozen R package on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org) and elsewhere). I am convinced that Science has to be Open and Reproducible, and the scientific community is slowly transiting in that direction. I use R, R Studio, the tidyverse, Git, Github and Travis-CI, plus the SciViews Box, as means to do reproducible research.

When I am not working, you can find me in my garden, or on a yoga mat. I am married to a wonderful and bright italian girl and I have a boy that happens to be equally creative (more in art than in science) and as technology addict as me. I also like photography, scuba diving, Indian or Japanese cooking, cartoons, good but healthy food, beer, wine, green tea and many, many more...

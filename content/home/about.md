# About Me

I am a second year student in biology, and i study at the university of Mons, Belgium. I am 19 years old and i have been interested in biology since childhood. Before the beginning of my second year, i wasn't sure what i should do as a professionnal, and even if im still not really sure, i have been interested in toxicology and parasites subjects that we saw in Histology, physiology and bio animal. Even if those subjects interests me, im still only in my second year (and in the beginning), thus i may change my mind at any time as i love most subjects related to biology .
